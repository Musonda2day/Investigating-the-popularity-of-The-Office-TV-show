# Investigating-the-popularity-of-The-Office-TV-show
The notebook in this repository provides an analysis of the popularity of the The Office TV show. It looks at the viewership and ratings of the different episodes as well as whether such episodes featured stars or not.

In this analysis, we construct a scatterplot that shows the viewership in millions against each episode from the first to the last episode. The size and shape of markers are plotted to indicate which episodes featured stars and which ones did not. The markers which featured stars are bigger and have a marker of a star. 

The markers are calor coded to represent the rating of the episode:

*Rating below 0.25 - red*

*Rating between 0.25 and 0.5 - orange*

*Rating between 0.5 and 0.75 - lightgreen*

*Rating above 0.75 - darkgreen*
